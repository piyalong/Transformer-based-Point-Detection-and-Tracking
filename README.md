# Transformer-based-Point-Detection-and-Tracking

A point detection algorithm using transformers is a type of computer vision algorithm that is designed to detect the presence and location of specific points or landmarks within an image. This algorithm is based on the transformer architecture, which was originally developed for natural language processing tasks and has recently been adapted for computer vision tasks.

The transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each made up of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward neural networks. The encoder is responsible for processing the input image and generating a set of feature maps that capture different levels of abstraction, while the decoder uses these feature maps to generate predictions about the location of the points of interest.
